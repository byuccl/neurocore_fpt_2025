Neurocore Artifacts

These are the artifacts used to compute the results in the Neurocore[1]
paper.

The overall workflow is broken into three parts.  First the designs
are generated using Vivado, then the designs are extracted from Vivado,
and finally the models are analyzed using the provided python script.
In the absence of Vivado, we have provided 25 already-extracted designs
from each dataset with which to evaluate the models.


Vivado Design Generation


Vivado Design Extraction

The easiest way to extract the required dump file from an implemented
checkpoint is using the following command:

vivado -mode batch -source src/dump.tcl -tclargs <path/to/checkpoint>

This path cannot have the trailing .dcp extension, as the dump script
uses the same path to compute both the dcp name as well as the name
for the resulting dump file.  The dump file will be placed in the same
directory as the checkpoint file.


Model Inference

We have developed the models and the inference script using python 3.12.
To install all necessary dependencies, we recommend setting up a virtual
environment with the command:

python -m venv .venv

Then the environment can be activated using:

. .venv/bin/activate

and then populated as follows:

pip install -r requirements.txt

The inference script should then be run:

python src/infer.py <model> <path_to.dump>

Where model is one of the following:

gat2.pt
sage.pt
gcn.pt
